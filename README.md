Hello world, 


Current implementation is only able to display data from the DB, and do a GET request to each url in the DB when starting up the page. The 'Add new url' btton does not work. 

Missing MVP implementation: 
- Call poller method at regular interval while server is running 
- Add React implementation to 'Create new url' button and connect it to backend java code to persist to DB
- More test classes

Difficulties encountered: 
- Learning about and setting up basic connection between separate components: MySQL, Vertx, JSX, React
- Refining and customizing behavior between different components 

Conclusion: 
I loved the project overall. But I lack the fundamental knowledge of these different web technologies as I have done very limited web development before. It is however one of the first things that I am planning on expanding my knowledge on. But for this assignment I would need more time to do fundamental tutorials in each framework/language before being able to wield them as I wish. 


Best, 
Bernard
